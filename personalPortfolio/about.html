        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the beautiful Meridian Idaho where I learned to love my community. I decided to pursue a career in software development because
            I see how passionate the community can be! I bring to the table technical 
            trouble-shooting skills and I have a love of learning. Additionally, I am a team player with excellent
            communication abilities. I am career driven, and am highly self-motivated and I pride myself as a professional. 
            After spending 6 years in the Navy, I know the importance knowing how to maintain project balance while using 
            problem solving to focus on priorities and meeting goals. 
            I also learned the benefit of completing tasks in a timely manner and how to properly handle sensitive material.</p>
